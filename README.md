<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>- This is an barber site that is including its own weekly queue system based on php backend.</p>
<p>- It has own special admin page. </p>
<p>- Also you can change the queue times  on admin page and see the costumers which take the queue.</p>
<p>- On admin page, you can add new cutting shop and costumers take the queues on another shop.(exatly you can delete the shop or queues)</p>
<p>- If you want, you would fix the frontend but I think it is not enough.I didnt scramble enough on it.</p>

<p>Here is 3 different colors boxes these mean the system allow or not allow you to take queue.The green box is ready state to take queue ,
the red box is taken from another person and the yellow box is time over state so now time is 14:40 and before the time is over.You can only choose after it.</p>
<p>Lets imagine, if the time is Saturday 20:01,the table shows us al of it yellow rigth? But it is considered.
After Saturday 20:01, the table will render new weekly schedule.</p>
