<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>- This is an barber site that is including its own weekly queue system based on php backend.</p>
<p>- It has own special admin page. </p>
<p>- Also you can change the queue times  on admin page and see the costumers which take the queue.</p>
<p>- On admin page, you can add new cutting shop and costumers take the queues on another shop.(exatly you can delete the shop or queues)</p>
<p>- If you want, you would fix the frontend but I think it is not enough.I didnt scramble enough on it.</p>
